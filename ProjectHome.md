This game is made entirely with FREE to download software: Unity3D, Blender 2.48a, and MonoDevelop. I am releasing this under the LGPL license. If you like to look at licenses, there is a link on the page as well as a txt file in the source.

The purpose of the game is to beat challenges of various difficulty. It is a 3D game that will hopefully help people trying to learn how to code video games. I will provide documentation in terms of how the game is organized, along with 3d models, animations, and code explanations.

I have already started it a few weeks ago, but it is getting big enough that I think this is the best place for it when it gets to its full size later on down the line.

Bare with me as I figure out Google code and figure out how to make this all work.
