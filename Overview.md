# Introduction #

As the Project Home states, this is an open source project I am working on that anyone can use for anything. I am not a master of the LGPL license, but you can use anything on here for commercial or non-commercial use.


# Details #

Since this project is still in its _figuring out_ stage, there won't be much details here for now. The game will slowly be taking shape as I have time outside of my job. Periodically, I will export it as a Windows and Mac application. It is best to use the SVN login to get the code and use it. My blog posts have some builds of it as well if you just want to play around with it.

I will try and keep the amount of resources that I use down to a minimum. All of these game files will really explode once I start going back with textures later and putting a lot more polish on them.

My first goal is to have the first challenge of the game done. It is merely going around and collecting some items. Not too difficult by itself, but I am making it more flexible for some of the later challenges when I get to them.
